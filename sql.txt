To check that populate db is correct you can use SQL-queries.

1. Total rows count 
SELECT COUNT (*) FROM public.pageviews 
SELECT COUNT (*) FROM public.atc_clicks
(should be 1M)

2. Unique fields count
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT impression_id) FROM public.atc_clicks 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT visitor_id) FROM public.pageviews
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product_id) FROM public.pageviews
(should be 500k, 700k, 200k)

3. Compliance with requirements for hosts
SELECT COUNT(url) FROM public.pageviews 
WHERE url ~ '(^http|^https)://(localhost|127.0.0.2|google.com|shop1.com|shop2.com|www.shop1.com|www.google.com|shop4.ru|www3.shop4.ru)'
(should be 1M)

Not listed in task hosts):
SELECT url FROM public.pageviews WHERE url !~ '(localhost|127.0.0.2|google.com|shop1.com|shop2.com|www.shop1.com|www.google.com|shop4.ru|www3.shop4.ru)'
 (should give empty result)
 
Only 'google.com' and 'www.google.com' urls:
SELECT count(url) FROM public.pageviews WHERE url ~ '(google.com)'

SELECT count(url) FROM public.pageviews WHERE url !~ '(localhost|127.0.0.2|shop1.com|shop2.com|www.shop1.com|shop4.ru|www3.shop4.ru)'
(should give same results in both queries)

5. Count of pageviews without clicks
SELECT COUNT(id) FROM public.pageviews 
	WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT impression_id FROM public.atc_clicks WHERE impression_id = public.pageviews.id)
(should be 500k)

6. Clicks count recorded for one impression:
SELECT MAX(count_clicks) FROM 
	(SELECT COUNT(impression_id) AS count_clicks FROM public.atc_clicks GROUP BY impression_id) t1
SELECT MIN(count_clicks) FROM 
	(SELECT COUNT(impression_id) AS count_clicks FROM public.atc_clicks GROUP BY impression_id) t1
(should be 6, 1)

7. How many unique products were visited in June?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p) FROM
	(SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM time) as t, product_id as p FROM public.pageviews) t1
WHERE t = 6
